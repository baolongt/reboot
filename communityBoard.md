# Community Board

- This board should be a blackholed canister (no entity can update the code).
- This board should enable every user-canister to write their name, principal id and mood of the day, and record the time.
- This board should implement an http_request.
- This board should be as simple and resistant to attacks from outsiders (filling out the memory, burning all the cycles...)
