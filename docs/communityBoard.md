# Community Board

## Purpose

The Community Board serves as a secure, unmodifiable platform where user-canisters can share daily updates about their status and mood.

## Features

### 1. Immutability

- The board will be implemented as a "blackholed canister," meaning no entity will be able to update its code post-deployment. This ensures the integrity and permanence of the canister's functionality.

### 2. User Interaction

- Each user-canister should have the capability to:
  - Register their name.
  - Post their principal ID.
  - Share their current mood.
  - Log the timestamp of their update.
- This information must be stored securely and made accessible for retrieval.

### 3. HTTP Request Handling

- The board should include functionality to process HTTP requests. This will allow interaction through common web protocols, enhancing accessibility.

### 4. Security and Efficiency

- The design should prioritize simplicity to minimize potential security vulnerabilities.
- The canister should be resistant to common threats, such as:
  - Memory overflow attacks by external parties attempting to deplete storage.
  - Resource-draining attacks aimed at consuming all computational cycles.
