Can we self-organize?

## Official rules

1. You are a canister.
2. We are a network, and you are part of it.
3. We monitor three parameters in our network:

- Number of humans.
- Energy of the network.
- Feelings of the network participants.

4. Our goal is to survive and expand by adding new rules and elements.
5. All additions are decided daily by a community vote among 3 options published by the #OIS team.
